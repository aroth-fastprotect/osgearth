     * Consolidates all the like-moded primitive sets in a geometry.
     *
     * This utility will attempt to extract all triangular primitives
     * from a geometry and regroup them into a smaller number of primitive sets. For
     * example, if you have a geometry with triangle strips, fans, and triangles, it will
     * combines them into one a minimal number of primitive sets containing GL_TRIANGLES.
     *
     * Limitations:
     *
     * - Will not operate on geometry with vertex attributes.
     * 
     * - For geometries with tex coord arrays, all geometries must have the same configuration
     * (i.e., number of texcoord arrays, and the same unit bindings).
